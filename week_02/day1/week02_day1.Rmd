```{r}
# Read in required libraries

library(janitor)
```

**Question 1**

Read in all 4 credit card transaction datasets and clean column names.

```{r}
# Read in data

cardbase        <- read_csv("data/CardBase.csv")
customerbase    <- read_csv("data/CustomerBase.csv")  
fraudbase       <- read_csv("data/FraudBase.csv")
transactionbase <- read_csv("data/TransactionBase.csv")
```

```{r}
# Clean column names

cardbase <- clean_names(cardbase)
customerbase <- clean_names(customerbase)
fraudbase <- clean_names(fraudbase)
transactionbase <- clean_names(transactionbase)
```

**Question 2**

Join the data containing card details and customer details by customer id, so that all records of card details and any matching records in customer details are kept. Before you run the code, think about how many rows you expect to see after joining.

- Expect to see same number of rows in joined data as in cardbase.

```{r}
cardbase<- cardbase %>% 
  left_join(
          customerbase,
          by = "cust_id"
          )
```


**Question 3**

Join the data containing fraud details with transaction details so all rows of both tables are kept. What does the resulting row number tell you?

- resulting number of rows shows that all transactions in fraudbase are also in transactionbase; there are no entries in fraudbase that are not in transactionbase
```{r}
fraud_trans_join <- fraudbase %>% 
  full_join(
            transactionbase,
            "transaction_id"
            )
```


**Question 4**

Join the data containing card details with transaction details so rows from the first which have matching ones in the second are returned.


```{r}
card_trans_join <- cardbase %>% 
  inner_join(
            transactionbase,
            by = c("card_number" = "credit_card_id")
            )
```


**Question 5**

Read in `hat_observations` and separate `observation` into two columns, `hat_colour` and `hat_type`.

```{r}
hat_observations <- read_csv("data/hat_observations.csv")

hat_observations <- hat_observations %>% 
   separate(
    col = observation,
    into = c("hat_colour", 
             "hat_type"),
    sep = ","
    ) 
```


**Question 6**

Unite `day`, `month`, and `year` columns into a column called `date` using a suitable separator. Then find the date where the most berets were observed.

```{r}
hat_observations <- hat_observations %>% 
   unite(
    col = "date",
    c(day, month, year),
    sep = "/"
    ) %>% 
  
filter(hat_type == "beret")

slice_max(hat_observations, observation_count)






```



Extension

## Joins

**Question 1**

Can you join all 4 datasets together so that you're left with a dataset that looks like below with **109 rows** and **12 columns**?

![](images/all_joined.png)

```{r}
trans_fraud <- right_join(transactionbase, fraudbase, by = "transaction_id")

final_table <- inner_join(
                        cardbase, 
                        trans_fraud,
                        by = c("card_number" = "credit_card_id")
                        )
```



**Question 2**

Read in `exam_scores` and transform it into long format with two new columns `exam_question` and `score`. Then, using `separate` and `select`, remove superfluous information from the values in `exam_question`

```{r}
exam_scores <- read_csv("data/exam_scores.csv")
```

```{r}
exam_scores <- exam_scores %>% 
  
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("exam"),
    names_to = "exam_question",
    values_to = "score"
  ) %>% 
  
  separate(
    col = exam_question,
    into = c("not_needed", "exam_question"),
    sep = "_Q"
    ) %>% 

  select(-not_needed)
  
```
